# MJM-020: Introduction to Journalism and Mass Communication

> Q1 - Technology, especially social media has often been found to spread misinformation and fake news. Use any two media society theories to explain the media audience relationship and prevalence of fake news and information. (400 words)

Ans:– Though Social media has become almost an inevitable part of our society now, we can’t always depend on it.

The spreading of misinformation in social media is not new. Every day we read bunches of things online on social media, which may happen to be true, often is not.

This false or misinformation leads to fake news i.e. consisted of fabricated stories, without any verifiable facts, sources, or quotes.

Those stories are forged to influence reader’s own opinions or to deceive them.

The question of fake news refers to the point of how to think about the nature of real news.

In the last few years, numbers of fake news stories have increased via social media platforms like What’s App, Facebook, YouTube, etc., because they are shared online faster than we can ever imagine.

There have been varied uses of the term Fake news in different reporting of news. During the second half of 2016, the term was searched tremendously by people shown in a Google Trends Map.

Most of the time Fake news conflates three different notions: misinformation, disinformation, and mal -information.

Misinformations are false information, but when a person conveys it, believes that it is true and shares.

Disinformation is those which are shared intentionally by a person after knowing that it is true.

On the other hand, information based on reality but imposes harm on a person, organization, or country is termed as mal -information. After putting all of them together, we call it fake news.

This information disorder consists of different forms like satire, false connection, misrepresentation of facts, imposter content, manipulated content, fabricated content, and memes.

There are mainly two reasons for sharing fake news on social media.

Some people spread it for political, ideological, or business interests, some also spread it for fun. But they do it with an intention.

However, again fake news is shared without knowing it’s fake by some people, but with a motive.

The motive can be varied from person to person. Few of them think sharing the information before others gives them a sense of pride.

While others think they must let people know about the importance of news and some commit it for fun.

Are we given enough contemplation before sharing information? Is it fake or real? Are we looking at an original piece of content? When and who created this content? Why is the content being shared? Why should we share it?

No, usually people never give a second thought before sharing content on social media.

After receiving content like violent video clips, images, memes, etc. people forget to verify about fake or real.

It happens because at that moment the only thing that triggers on people’s minds is to let the people know about the content and its consequences.

There are very few different cases with some, who inquire ” is the content fake?”

However, here the problem lies with the human mind and the fake news. Our brains have a limited capability for processing information and for remembering, so the brain makes judgments on what to keep.

Looking into that fact, the contents which are more familiar to people, or it has an impact on people due to some previous personal issues are especially shared in social media.

Certainly, at that moment the brain can recall the previous effect of that content and without giving a second thought frequently passes the judgments.

During this COVID-19 period, there are varieties of fake news on COVID-19 which are spreading in social media and among the people very speedily.

From offering unvaried home remedies to tackle the virus to floating fake advisories asking people to avoid food such as ice cream and chicken, sharing conspiracy theories, Indian’s phones are being flooded with misinformation.

Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi also requested the citizens not heed to the rumours surrounding Covid-19.

There are different ways to identify fake news and stay accurately informed.

It frequently has a clear bias, and it may strive to inspire anger or other strong feelings from the reader.

Such content may come from unfamiliar news sources so here verification is the most important way.

We have to verify the fake news by both traditional verification methods or online verification tools process.

The traditional verification method specifically means getting on to the primary source and verify it.

It can be sourced or emailing the person/organization and also by reading different original documents concerned to the news.

After that, we have to cross-check the information with at least one more source and apply this method also regarding online verification.

Likewise, there are certain tools and techniques for online verification methods. Again to verify an image/photo, to know it’s fake or real we can do a Reverse Image Search in Google or any Search engine by using the image.

It can tell if the image is used earlier.

It also shows how old the image is, and if it has been used before for other contexts.

Also, if any fact-checker has reported about the matter already, that story will appear too.

The same process is also used to verify a video clip of fake news.
Though there are different ways to prevent fake news in social media, sometimes they are not enough.

Because there are no editors in social media to allow the spread of any content without verifying it.

So, if an option like, ” Is the content real?” will appear before sharing content may be more helpful to people. But we social media users also have to play an important role.

Instead of demanding the social media companies to take the necessary steps, we can be the editors ourselves by learning the research process of checking the truth behind the fake content.

Personal responsibility is the first and fundamental step to protect our society from this fake content.

Northeast will become driver of India’s growth: PM Modi
The Northeast will become the driver of India’s growth story, he said, after dedicating to the nation and laying the foundation stone for 22 development projects worth Rs 4,815 crore in Manipur.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi Tuesday accused the previous governments in New Delhi of neglecting the Northeast, as he launched a raft of development projects ahead of the assembly elections due in the state early next year.

The Northeast will become the driver of India’s growth story, he said, after dedicating to the nation and laying the foundation stone for 22 development projects worth Rs 4,815 crore in Manipur.

Kicking off the BJP’s campaign for the assembly elections, the prime minister inaugurated an Integrated Command and Control Centre for the Imphal Smart City Mission, development of western river front on Imphal river, an industrial training institute (ITI) and a 200-bed semi-permanent Covid hospital, among others.

Modi also laid the foundation stone of five national highway construction projects, government residential quarters, Manipur Institute of Performing Arts, Centre for Invention, Innovation, Incubation and Training (CIIIT), the biggest PPP initiative in Manipur, a state-of-the-art cancer hospital, besides several other projects.

These projects are aimed at development of infrastructure and connectivity, skilling and employment of youth, renovation of places of historic and spiritual importance, and improvement of healthcare facilities. (With PTI inputs)

Northeast will become major driver of India’s growth: PM Modi in Manipur
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that the Northeastern states will become major drivers of India’s growth in the upcoming years with Manipur as the main source of the country’s growth trajectory.

While addressing the inauguration programme of developmental projects here, PM Modi said as Manipur will be completing 50 years of statehood on January 21,

the state “will become the main source of India’s growth trajectory and will stretch its potential to other parts of India via enhanced road connectivity and infrastructure projects.”

Adding that the Northeast is all set to become the “new gate of development” for the country, PM Modi said, “The Northeast, where Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose’s army hoisted the flag for the first time calling it the gateway to India’s independence, is now becoming the gateway to fulfil the dreams of New India.”

PM Modi inaugurated and laid the foundation stone of several developmental projects here today.

PM Modi inaugurated 13 Projects worth over Rs 1,850 crores and laid the foundation stone of nine projects worth around Rs 2,950 crore; spanning across sectors such as Road Infrastructure, Drinking Water Supply, Health, Urban Development, IT and more.

He also laid the foundation stone of construction of five National Highway Projects to be built at a cost of more than Rs 1,700 crore, with a cumulative length of more than 110 km. With ANI inputs

**Q4 - ** OTT platforms host content that go an extra mile in building interactivity with the audience and make the experience more immersive. Analyse the features that make the medium special along with the data that shows its growth during the pandemic period.

Ans:- Another year has been lost to the pandemic, and various sectors such as real estate, hospitality and mobility are counting their losses and making projections of when they’re likely to attain their pre-Covid growth levels.

Amid this doom and gloom, the media and entertainment sector presents an encouraging picture.

According to a recent report by the Confederation of Indian Industry and Boston Consulting Group, India’s media and entertainment industry has revived to pre-Covid levels and is expected to grow to $55-70 bn by 2030 at 10-12% CAGR, driven mainly by strong growth in OTT, gaming, animation and VFX.

The report explains that the media and entertainment industry contracted by 10% year-on-year in 2020, its market size decreasing from $26 bn in 2019, to around $24 bn in 2020.

This contraction was mainly due to a decline in advertising revenues across mediums such as print, television and radio.

However, digital led-consumption of OTT services and gaming are now driving the growth, helping the industry grow 12-16% year-on-year in 2021, to a market size of $27 bn.

Today, OTT has a 7-9% market share in India’s $27 bn M&E industry.

However, by 2030, its market share is expected to increase to 22%-25%. Meanwhile, television’s market share will decline from around 35% to 24%.

The growth in the number of Indian households with a Pay TV subscription, such as Tata Sky and Dish TV has more or less stabilised, only growing at 2%.

However, India is seeing a growth of 51% in the number of households with a subscription-based video-on-demand service or SVOD.

This growth in subscription-based OTT services offered by the likes of Netflix, Amazon’s Prime Video and Disney+ Hotstar can be attributed to the improved internet and smartphone penetration and payment mechanisms.

Most importantly, these players have made significant investments in content, pricing innovations and bundling to create niche properties.

Notably, streaming giants such as Netflix are offering their India plans at affordable prices, compared to the pricing plans for other geographies.

The CII-BCG report explains that the Indian pricing plans of global streaming giants are on average, 70-90% cheaper than their prices for the US market.

Increased market competition, with local OTT players also entering the fray, are driving this reduction in prices for OTT services. And global streaming giants are keeping their fingers crossed.

In 2020, the global executives for Disney+ noted that the company’s India offering, Disney+ Hotstar, brought down its global average revenue per user (ARPU).

And last year, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said that the company was ‘still figuring out the Indian market’, also calling it a ‘speculative investment’, comparing the Indian market of 2021 with the Japanese and South Korean markets of five years before.

As the experts pointed out, the Indian OTT industry has just started scaling up, and will continue to remain a high volume market.

Hence, expect more pricing experiments and bundling of OTT services with your mobile data plans as more global streaming players tap into the Indian market.

Devices Used for OTT streaming

➢ 89% of users stream videos via mobile devices.
➢ 58% of users stream videos via TV Apps.

Growth rates of devices for streaming content- 2020-2021

➢ Smart TVs experienced the biggest growth
➢ Tablets are being used 43% more often,
➢ Desktops are being used 38% more,
➢ Mobile phones are being used 29% more

Revenue in the OTT Video segment is projected to reach US$2,673m in 2022.
Revenue is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2022-2026) of 10.10%, resulting in a projected market volume of US$3,928m by 2026.

India has 353 million OTT users and 96 million active paid subscriptions, which translates into a penetration of 25.3%.

**Q5 - ** Conceptualise and plan an event for fund raising for paying the exam fees of girls who are about to appear in their board exams and their parents have lost their source of livelihood due to the pandemic.

Ans:- More than 3.7 million girls in India are out of school. Without an education, these girls remain socially and economically immobile and vulnerable to discrimination, with little hope for an independent future.

Gender inequality damages the physical and mental health of millions of girls and women across the globe, and also of boys and men despite the many tangible benefits it gives men through resources, power, authority and control.

Because of the numbers of people involved and the magnitude of the problems, taking action to improve gender equity in health and to address women’s rights to health is one of the most direct and potent ways to reduce health inequities and ensure effective use of health resources.

Deepening and consistently implementing human rights instruments can be a powerful mechanism to motivate and mobilize governments, people and especially women themselves.

Education Crowdfunding helps teachers, students and NGOs raise funds to buy classroom supplies, take children on special field trips and build toilets.

Crowdfunding can also provide funds for distributing daily meals, upgrade school infrastructures like gymnasium, play areas, classroom renovation and expansion. Online crowdfunding for education is gaining more and more recognition.

It is safe, easy and effective, and can reach a much larger pool of people in far less time.

The current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is having a profound impact, not only on people’s health, but also on how they learn, work and live.

Among the most important challenges created by COVID-19 is how to adapt a system of education built around physical schools.

At its peak, more than 188 countries, encompassing around 91% of enrolled learners worldwide, closed their schools to try to contain the spread of the virus.1 School closures have a very real impact on all students, but especially on the most vulnerable ones who are more likely to face additional barriers.

Children and youth from low-income and single-parent families; immigrant, refugee, ethnic minority and Indigenous backgrounds; with diverse gender identities and sexual orientations; and those with special education needs suffer by being deprived of physical learning opportunities, social and emotional support available in schools and extra services such as school meals.

They risk falling further behind and becoming isolated with school doors closed.

These students are likely to lose the most in terms of educational outcomes and the support provided by schools if countries take insufficient measures to promote educational equity and inclusion.

During the coronavirus crisis, many countries have been using digital pedagogical tools and virtual exchanges between students and their teachers, and among students, to deliver education as schools closed.

Vulnerable students might however have little access to such tools and require further attention and support.

To respond to the challenges they face, countries have developed specific and sometimes innovative policy initiatives such as providing equitable and inclusive access to digital learning resources and good learning conditions, ensuring that socio-emotional needs are being met, offering equitable and inclusive access to extra services for vulnerable students, and ensuring support by and to teacher.

Collect some recent facts on climate change and write a news piece in the inverted pyramid style. Then convert the same story into a feature based on the same facts.<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

**Ans:** – The inverted pyramid is perfectly suited for the web – on any screen size. We know that users don’t read carefully online.

They have little patience for content that doesn’t engage them. Users scroll, but only when they think that the content they want or need will appear on that page.

<div class="code-block code-block-14" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;"><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>

The inverted pyramid style addresses all of these aspects of user behavior.

**Using the inverted pyramid style can:**

I**mprove comprehension**: Users can quickly form a mental model and a general understanding of the article, making it easier to understand the details that follow.

**Decrease interaction cost:** Users can understand the main point of the page without having to spend a lot of time reading.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 21 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

**Encourage scrolling**: This structure can encourage scrolling by engaging the audience with the main point, and drawing them in to the details that follow.

S**tructure content logically:** Starting with broad information sets the stage for what follows.

Elements like anchor or jump links can become unnecessary when content is structured to draw the user down the page.

S**upport readers who skim**: Readers can stop reading at any point on the page and still come away with the main point.

Write in the Inverted Pyramid Style Identify your key points.

What piece of information is the key fact you want your readers to know, even if they only read a single paragraph or sentence on the page? What effectively summarizes all the information that will follow?

Rank secondary information. Outline the story details and supporting information, prioritizing the information that is most likely to be of interest to the broadest audience, and moving down the list to the smaller and more nuanced details.  
Write well and concisely.

The structure only helps readers if the content is strong. Cut unnecessary information.

Get to the point quickly. Use straightforward language. Use short paragraphs and bulleted lists.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 21 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Frontload all elements of content with important information. The main headline should be descriptive. The story should start with the main point.

Each heading or subheading should be descriptive. The first sentence of every paragraph should be the most important.

The first words in each sentence should be information-carrying and indicate what content will follow.

Consider adding a summary or list of highlights. Some sites go a step beyond and add a summary (like this article does) or a bulleted list of key points to further emphasize the main takeaways of the content.

(1\. Within the next 2 decades, global temperatures are likely to rise 1.5 degrees Celsius

In its highly-anticipated Sixth Report this year, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated that a certain amount of global warming is locked in and is irreversible.

This means that within the next two decades, global temperatures are likely to rise 1.5 degrees Celsius.

In its 2018 special report, the IPCC warned that we only have until 2030 to prevent the worst impacts of climate change.

Yet little has changed since then to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That’s terrifying.

In 2019, global carbon emissions from fossil fuels and industry reached a high of 36.44 billion metric tons.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 21 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

In 2020, emissions fell by 5.8 percent due to COVID-19 and the resulting economic crisis.

Despite last year’s reverse trend, however, 2021 emissions are expected to again grow by nearly 5 percent, to 33 billion tons.

(2\. The last 7 years have been the warmest on record 2020 tied 2016 as the hottest year on record, according to NASA.

Notably, 2020’s temperature level was hit without it being an El Niño year, as it was in 2016.

“The last seven years have been the warmest seven years on record, typifying the ongoing and dramatic warming trend,” said Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) Director Gavin Schmidt.

“Whether one year is a record or not is not really that important — the important things are longterm trends.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 21 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

With these trends, and as the human impact on the climate increases, we have to expect that records will continue to be broken.”

(3\. More than 1 million species are at risk of extinction by climate change  
Imagine dressing up as a frog for Halloween and having to explain to younger generations what it was and why it’s gone.

Almost half of all amphibians are at risk of extinction due to climate change — so this could be a reality if we don’t act soon.

Extinction is a natural phenomenon, claiming about five species per year.

But some experts suggest we’re in the midst of the sixth mass extinction — one that is caused mostly by human activity.

Scientists estimate dozens of species of plants and animals currently go extinct each day — nearly 1,000 times the natural rate.

By mid-century, as many as 30 to 50 percent of the total species found on Earth will have disappeared.

What is the Pegasus issue? Write an article focusing on the issue and highlighting the concerns of privacy and Indian Government’s take on it.**<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

Ans: – In November 2019, a tech reporter from New York City photographed an interception device displayed at Milipol, a trade show on homeland security in Paris.

The exhibitor, NSO Group, placed the hardware at the back of a van, perhaps suggesting convenience of portability, and said it would not work on US phone numbers, possibly due to a self-imposed restriction by the firm.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 21 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Since the Israeli cyber giant was founded in 2010, that was probably the first time an NSO-made portable Base Transceiver Station (BTS) was featured in a media report.

A BTS — or ‘rogue cell tower’ or ‘IMSI Catcher’ or ‘stingray’ — impersonates legitimate cellular towers and forces mobile phones within a radius to connect to it, so that the intercepted traffic can be manipulated by an attacker.

The BTS photographed in 2019 was composed of horizontally-stacked cards, likely to allow interception over multiple frequency bands.

The other option is to leverage access to the target’s mobile operator itself.

In that scenario, an attacker would not need any rogue cell tower but would rely on the regular network infrastructure for manipulation.

Pegasus aka Q Suite, marketed by the NSO Group aka Q Cyber Technologies as “a world-leading cyber intelligence solution that enables law enforcement and intelligence agencies to remotely and covertly extract” data “from virtually any mobile devices”, was developed by veterans of Israeli intelligence agencies.

Until early 2018, NSO Group clients primarily relied on SMS and WhatsApp messages to trick targets into opening a malicious link, which would lead to infection of their mobile devices.

A Pegasus brochure described this as Enhanced Social Engineering Message (ESEM).

When a malicious link packaged as ESEM is clicked, the phone is directed to a server that checks the operating system and delivers the suitable remote exploit.

In its October 2019 report, Amnesty International first documented use of ‘network injections’ which enabled attackers to install the spyware “without requiring any interaction by the target”.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 21 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Pegasus can achieve such zero-click installations in various ways.

One over-the-air (OTA) option is to send a push message covertly that makes the target device load the spyware, with the target unaware of the installation over which she anyway has no control.

This, a Pegasus brochure brags, is “NSO uniqueness, which significantly differentiates the Pegasus solution” from any other spyware available in the market.

The past few days have once again provided extensive evidence of a cyberattack on Indian citizens.

Barring the evasive statements issued by various ministers of the Government of India, we are yet to hear any substantive explanation of why phone numbers of several Indian politicians, including Rahul Gandhi,

activists and lawyers were found to be amongst the 50,000 other phone numbers believed to be potential surveillance targets by governments around the world.

It is correct that for a variety of reasons, forensic testing that might have revealed infection by NSO’s Pegasus was not possible in each of these cases.

But the presence of these numbers does call for a thorough investigation, instead of another word salad being offered by the government.

The French and Israeli governments have already ordered an investigation.

Most followers of this controversy will remember that this is not the first time the current government has been accused of snooping on civilians.

In 2019, it was alleged that NSO’s software was used by GoI to exploit a vulnerability in WhatsApp to illegally spy on 24 citizens, and hack as many as 121 Indians.

All that resulted in was bombastic denials by ministers, and blocking of any action by the ruling party.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 21 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology chaired by Shashi Tharoor had held some hearings but no substantive outcome resulted or at least no information was made public.

Such inaction across board leaves us citizens to wonder whether the surveillance structure is one where all parties are complicit and the inaction is deliberate after some obligatory public outrage.

Students will demonstrate ability to employ various research methods to collect and analyze quantitative data and qualitative information for news.

Such methods include, but are not limited to court and other public documents, surveys, and computer databases.

**Ethical Research** :

Students will apply ethical standards to assess data and information for accuracy, reliability, and relevance.

Such methods include, but are not limited to the use of computer spreadsheets and databases.

A central problem in the practice of journalism is that most of the time, we are trying to engage in narrative and analysis at the same time.

They don’t naturally go together. Journalists more often unwittingly let the narrative distort the analysis than vice versa.

What follows is an attempt at a journalistic version of the scientific method, aimed at protecting us from writing stories that are factually accurate and narratively compelling, but still fail to capture the truth of a situation.

Awareness. On any complicated subject, beware, when you set out, of overly simple conceptions of what ‘the story’ is. Often these involve your having unwittingly accepted somebody else’s frame of reference, or having been primed to see the story in a certain way, or having mistaken correlation for causation, or having succumbed to some other form of embedded misperception.

As a first step, you should always stop and ask yourself what you have bought into before you have begun.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 21 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Forming a hypothesis. It’s healthier to admit to yourself that you have one than to go into a story with the idea that you have no presuppositions at all – that would be impossible.

You should state a working hypothesis (to yourself, anyway), and then ask yourself what would prove the hypothesis false and what would be an alternate hypothesis to explain whatever it is you are investigating.

As you report, you should try not just to prove but also to disprove your working hypothesis, and you should engage in a continuing process of revision of the hypothesis, if necessary.

If you don’t design your reporting in such a way that if your hypothesis is flawed, you will find that out before you finish the story, then you are leaving yourself open to getting the story seriously wrong.

Mapping the discourse. On any important issue, there is likely to be a long-running debate with a set of established compass points.

Therefore the idea that you can find ‘an expert’ who can explain the issue quickly over the phone is unrealistic, and so, probably, is the idea that you can find two experts, one on each side, who between them can do justice to the subject.

Instead, you should familiarize yourself with the expert discourse on the subject.

You don’t need to read everything, but you need to know what the major schools of thought are, and where the debate stands at present, and you should be able to read the primary material for yourself as a way of enriching what other people tell you about it.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 21 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Evaluating the data. Never accept a conclusion from an expert at face value.  
Instead, you should follow the steps that led to the conclusion, and you should make some judgment as to whether the methodology and presentation are sound.

You should also find out whether somebody else has drawn a different conclusion about the same subject.

Transparency. Journalism is not scholarship and does not generally use bibliographies or footnotes, but you should use attribution in your work in such a way that readers and colleagues can see, to the greatest extent possible,

where your information came from and how you have reached your conclusions.

Therefore, the use of anonymous sources should be kept to a minimum – you should always try to avoid saying something important with only the testimony of an unnamed person as proof.

Even your journalistic competitors should be able to tell, from your work, how to pursue your story further.

Skilling has emerged as a buzzword. The push for a policy-backed skill development initiative is a significant step towards realising the potential of the workforce by enhancing its employability.

The initiative seeks to strengthen institutional training, infrastructure, training of trainers, overseas employment, sustainable livelihoods and leveraging of public infrastructure.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 21 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

But there exists a huge gap between the current status and the desired goals in terms of a skilled workforce.

The foremost challenge is the huge proportion of poorly-trained workers in the informal sector—the largest employment generator in India.

The large majority of skill training is carried out through selftaught practices, observation or a transfer of skills from a master craftsperson to an apprentice.

The proportion of formally skilled workers in India is extremely low, at 4.69% of total workforce, compared to 24% in China, 52% in the US, 68% in the UK, 75% in Germany, 80% in Japan and 96% in South Korea.

The mismatch between skill, academic training and employment has broadened to an extent where, on one hand, employers are unable to discover suitably trained people, and on the other, the youth is unable to find the kind of jobs they aspire for.

According to the latest India Skill Report (2019), only 45.6% of the youth graduating from educational institutions are employable.

To address this mismatch, it is imperative to understand the ‘return on skill’ (ROS) concept.

Common sense tells us that a skilled person is in a better position to enhance his earnings.

But to be able to understand the impact of skills on employment, one needs to take a closer and analytical look at it.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 21 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

The International Standard Classification of Occupations (ILO, ISCO-08) provides a framework to make it possible to compare occupational data internationally.

ISCO-08 does not seek to substitute the existing National Classification of Occupations, but enables inter-country comparisons by aligning occupational classifications to ISCO-08 in concept and structure.

In the Indian context, many studies estimate return on education at the national level using NSSO data, India Human Development Surveys I and II (IHDS), National Data Survey on Savings Patterns of India, etc.

But there are hardly any studies that investigate the labour-market ROS due to the absence of skill-based earning data.

Ans: – Even before the pandemic, issues like constantly evolving technological advancements, lack of adequate skills, and new ways of working were disrupting the jobs and skilling ecosystem.

The coronavirus pandemic has only accelerated the pace of workforce & workplace disruption.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 21 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

As we emerge out of the crisis, business leaders are rethinking how to prepare their workforces, from predicting the future skills required, to keeping pace with a fast-paced technological climate.

Against this backdrop, The Economic Times and The DataTech Labs organised a discussion titled “Leveraging New Age Enterprise Workforce” where some of the prominent experts from across industries participated to discuss strategies to ensure that their employees are equipped with the skills & technology tools that are critical to their business recovery models.

Digital technologies are everywhere, affecting the way we live, work, travel and play.

Digitalisation is helping improve the safety, productivity, accessibility and sustainability of energy systems around the world.

But it is also raising new security and privacy risks, while disrupting markets, businesses and workers.

Digitalisation & Energy is the International Energy Agency’s first comprehensive effort to depict how digitalisation could transform the world’s energy systems.

The report examines the impact of digital technologies on energy demand sectors, looks at how energy suppliers can use digital tools to improve operations, and explores the transformational potential of digitalisation to help create a highly interconnected energy system.

This report seeks to provide greater clarity to decision makers in government and industry on what digitalisation means for energy, shining a light on its enormous potential and most pressing challenges.

It also lays out no-regret recommendations to help steer the world towards a more secure, sustainable and smarter energy future.

Over the coming decades, digital technologies are set to make energy systems around the world more connected, intelligent, efficient, reliable and sustainable.

Stunning advances in data, analytics and connectivity are enabling a range of new digital applications such as smart appliances, shared mobility, and 3D printing.

Digitalised energy systems in the future may be able to identify who needs energy and deliver it at the right time, in the right place and at the lowest cost. But getting everything right will not be easy.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 21 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Digitalisation is already improving the safety, productivity, accessibility and sustainability of energy systems.

But digitalisation is also raising new security and privacy risks. It is also changing markets, businesses and employment.

New business models are emerging, while some century-old models may be on their way out.

Policy makers, business executives and other stakeholders increasingly face new and complex decisions, often with incomplete or imperfect information.

Adding to this challenge is the extremely dynamic nature of energy systems, which are often built on large, long-lived physical infrastructure and assets.

Digitalisation trends are truly astounding. Data are growing at an exponential rate – internet traffic has tripled in only the past five years and around 90% of the data in the world today were created over the past two years.

This exponential growth has led to the use of increasingly large units of measurement.

For example, global annual internet traffic surpassed the exabyte threshold in 2001 and is expected to pass the zettabyte threshold by 2017.

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Q_5_A_story_of_a_reputed_newspaper_highlighted_that_there_are_still_considerable_percentage_of_women_in_the_country_who_justify_wife_beating_Write_a_story_on_the_socio_economic_factors_that_lead_to_development_of_such_psyche_among_women_citing_data_from_credible_sources_Also_suggest_plausible_solutions_for_the_problem"></span>**Q 5.** A story of a reputed newspaper highlighted that there are still considerable percentage of women in the country who justify wife beating.

Also suggest plausible solutions for the problem.<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

**Ans**: – Major life transitions such as pregnancy, motherhood and menopause can create physical and emotional stresses for women.

Negative life experiences – infertility and perinatal loss, poverty, discrimination, violence, unemployment and isolation – also impact on women’s mental health and wellbeing.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 21 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Unequal economic and social conditions also contribute to women’s higher risk of depression.

Gender inequality refers to the differences between genders in terms of status, power, wealth, health, and employment.

When these differences are avoidable and unfair, it is known as gender inequity.

Gender inequity is the product of sexism, which is prejudice or discrimination against people based on their sex or gender. It primarily impacts women and girls, with consequences that begin at birth.

Some of the measurable ways that gender inequity affects women globally, in comparison with men, include Trusted Source:

• lower rates of schooling and employment  
• less pay for similar work

• higher levels of stress  
• higher rates of unpaid work, such as caring for sick relatives

• exposure to higher rates of sexual assault, intimate partner abuse, and gender- based violence  
• a lack of representation in government

S**ome of the ways that sexism affects everyday life include:**

• sexist remarks  
• sexual harassment  
• workplace discrimination <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 21 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

All of these have a significant impact on the mental and physical health of women and girls, as well as people of other marginalized genders.

Unlike sex, which is based on biological traits such as genitalia, gender refers to how people feel about themselves.

As a result, anyone can experience gender inequity and sexism based on how they behave and express themselves.

Traumatic events can affect people differently. If the symptoms persist for long periods after a traumatic event, people may meet the criteria for PTSD.

Women are slightly less likely to experience a traumatic event than men. But the types of trauma women experience are more likely to lead to PTSD.

This includes child abuse and sexual assault, which 1 in 3 women in the United States endure during their lifetime. In men, the rate is around 1 in 10.

Women are also more likely to experience childhood neglect, intimate partner abuse, the sudden loss of a loved one, and harmful practices such as female genital mutilation (FGM).

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3 million girlsTrusted Source undergo FGM every year, most of whom are under the age of 15 years old.

Experiencing a traumatic event can lead to depression and anxiety.

Depression and anxiety are 2–4 timesTrusted Source more prevalent in women who have experienced intimate partner violence, on average, than in the general population.

Childhood abuse is also strongly linkedTrusted Source to depression.

Household responsibilities :<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 21 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Despite the fact that in many countries it is common in two-parent households for both parents to work, women still spend more time on parenting and housework than men.

A 2014 nationwide study looking at women physicians and academics found that among those with partners and children, women spent, on average, 8.5 hours more each week on domestic chores.

Among those with partners who had full-time employment, women were also more likely to take time off from their jobs to take care of children.

Caregiving :

Women provide unofficial care to family members and others more oftenTrusted Source than men. Caring can negatively impact a person’s mental and physical health.

Caregivers have higher stress levels than those who are not caregivers, and women caregivers report more stress and health problemsTrusted Source than men caregivers.

Research also links caregiving with a higher incidence of depression in women of childbearing age.

There are many factors that could contribute to this. Informal caregiving can result in people:

• getting less sleep or exercise  
• having less leisure time <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 21 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

• earning less money, putting them at a higher risk of poverty  
• becoming socially isolated  
• Any of these can increase strain on a person’s mental health.

**Sexual harassment :**

Sexual harassment refers to unwanted sexual comments or advances. A survey from the National Sexual Violence Resource Center found that around twice as many women experience sexual harassment as men.

During their lifetime, 81% of women and 43% of men reported at least one incident. Women with disabilities were the most likely to experience physically aggressive harassment and assault.

For most people, the age they first experienced harassment was between 14–17 years old.

Gender stereotypes continue to exist and are transmitted through media, and through social, educational and recreational socialization, which promote gender prejudice and discrimination.

This paper argues that contemporary management culture does not critically engage with the social theories of gender studies, which could help in developing gender-neutral affirmative action-oriented managerial perspectives.

Many gender-related barriers and biases have declined over the years but gender stereotypes continue to create problems in the progress of women’s careers.

The availability of opportunities for the career progressions of women continues to be negatively affected by gender stereotypes, which shape managerial behaviour and occupational outlooks in the workplace with patriarchal expectations.

**Ans**: – Agricultural pollution refers to biotic and abiotic byproducts of farming practices that result in contamination or degradation of the environment and surrounding ecosystems, and/or cause injury to humans and their economic interests.

The pollution may come from a variety of sources, ranging from point source water pollution (from a single discharge point) to more diffuse, landscape-level causes, also known as non-point source pollution and air pollution.

<div class="code-block code-block-14" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;"><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>

Once in the environment these pollutants can have both direct effects in surrounding ecosystems, i.e. killing local wildlife or contaminating drinking water, and downstream effects such as dead zones caused by agricultural runoff is concentrated in large water bodies.

Management practices, or ignorance of them, play a crucial role in the amount and impact of these pollutants.

Management techniques range from animal management and housing to the spread of pesticides and fertilizers in global agricultural practices.

Bad management practices include poorly managed animal feeding operations, overgrazing, plowing, fertilizer, and improper, excessive, or badly timed use of pesticides.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 22 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Pollutants from agriculture greatly affect water quality and can be found in lakes, rivers, wetlands, estuaries, and groundwater.

Pollutants from farming include sediments, nutrients, pathogens, pesticides, metals, and [salt](https://webservices.ignou.ac.in/assignments/)s.

Animal agriculture has an outsized impact on pollutants that enter the environment.

Bacteria and pathogens in manure can make their way into streams and groundwater if grazing, storing manure in lagoons and applying manure to fields is not properly managed.

Air pollution caused by agriculture through land use changes and animal agriculture practices have an outsized impact on climate change, and addressing these concerns were a central part of the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land.

Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.

There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane, carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules.

Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans;

it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain).

Both human activity and natural processes can generate air pollution.

Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, COPD, stroke and lung cancer.

Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression[3] and detrimental perinatal health.

The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body’s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system.

Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual’s health status and genetics.

Outdoor air pollution alone causes 2.1 to 4.21 million deaths annually, making it one of the top contributors to human death.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 22 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, and is the world’s largest single environmental health risk.

Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world’s worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World’s Worst Polluted Places report.

The scope of the air pollution crisis is enormous: 90% of the world’s population breathes dirty air to some degree.

Although the health consequences are extensive, the way the problem is handled is often haphazard

A coral reef is an underwater ecosystem characterized by reef-building corals.

Reefs are formed of colonies of coral polyps held together by calcium carbonate. Most coral reefs are built from stony corals, whose polyps cluster in groups.

Coral belongs to the class Anthozoa in the animal phylum Cnidaria, which includes sea anemones and jellyfish.

Unlike sea anemones, corals secrete hard carbonate exoskeletons that support and protect the coral.

Most reefs grow best in warm, shallow, clear, sunny and agitated water.

Coral reefs first appeared 485 million years ago, at the dawn of the Early Ordovician, displacing the microbial and sponge reefs of the Cambrian.

Sometimes called rainforests of the sea, shallow coral reefs form some of Earth’s most diverse ecosystems.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 22 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

They occupy less than 0.1% of the world’s ocean area, about half the area of France, yet they provide a home for at least 25% of all marine species, including fish, mollusks, worms, crustaceans, echinoderms, sponges, tunicates and other cnidarians.

Coral reefs flourish in ocean waters that provide few nutrients.

They are most commonly found at shallow depths in tropical waters, but deep water and cold water coral reefs exist on smaller scales in other areas.

Coral reefs have declined by 50% since 1950, partly because they are sensitive to water conditions.

They are under threat from excess nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), rising temperatures, oceanic acidification, overfishing (e.g., from blast fishing, cyanide fishing, spearfishing on scuba), sunscreen use, and harmful land-use practices, including runoff and seeps (e.g., from injection wells and cesspools)

Flooding is a temporary overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. Floods are the most common natural disaster in the United States.

Failing to evacuate flooded areas or entering flood waters can lead to injury or death.

**Floods may:**<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 22 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

• Result from rain, snow, coastal storms, storm surges and overflows of dams and other water systems.

• Develop slowly or quickly. Flash floods can come with no warning.

• Cause outages, disrupt transportation, damage buildings and create landslides.

Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river, lake, or ocean, in which the water overtops or breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries, or it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood.

While the size of a lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes in precipitation and snow melt, these changes in size are unlikely to be considered significant unless they flood property or drown domestic animals.

A landslide is defined as the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth down a slope.

Landslides are a type of “mass wasting,” which denotes any down-slope movement of soil and rock under the direct influence of gravity.

The term “landslide” encompasses five modes of slope movement: falls, topples, slides, spreads, and flows.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 22 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

These are further subdivided by the type of geologic material (bedrock, debris, or earth).

Debris flows (commonly referred to as mudflows or mudslides) and rock falls are examples of common landslide types.

Almost every landslide has multiple causes. Slope movement occurs when forces acting down-slope (mainly due to gravity) exceed the strength of the earth materials that compose the slope.

Causes include factors that increase the effects of down-slope forces and factors that contribute to low or reduced strength.

Landslides can be initiated in slopes already on the verge of movement by rainfall, snowmelt, changes in water level, stream erosion, changes in ground water, earthquakes, volcanic activity, disturbance by human activities, or any combination of these factors.

Earthquake shaking and other factors can also induce landslides underwater. These landslides are called submarine landslides.

Submarine landslides sometimes cause tsunamis that damage coastal areas.

**Ans:** – Omicron : Researchers in South Africa and around the world are conducting studies to better understand many aspects of Omicron and will continue to share the findings of these studies as they become available.

Transmissibility: It is not yet clear whether Omicron is more transmissible (e.g., more easily spread from person to person) compared to other variants, including Delta.

The number of people testing positive has risen in areas of South Africa affected by this variant, but epidemiologic studies are underway to understand if it is because of Omicron or other factors.

Severity of disease: It is not yet clear whether infection with Omicron causes more severe disease compared to infections with other variants, including Delta.

Preliminary data suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalization in South Africa, but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected, rather than a result of specific infection with Omicron.

There is currently no information to suggest that symptoms associated with Omicron are different from those from other variants.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 22 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Initial reported infections were among university students—younger individuals who tend to have more mild disease—but understanding the level of severity of the Omicron variant will take days to several weeks.

All variants of COVID-19, including the Delta variant that is dominant worldwide, can cause severe disease or death, in particular for the most vulnerable people, and thus prevention is always key.

Preliminary evidence suggests there may be an increased risk of reinfection with Omicron (ie, people who have previously had COVID-19 could become reinfected more easily with Omicron), as compared to other variants of concern, but information is limited.

More information on this will become available in the coming days and weeks.

Effectiveness of vaccines: WHO is working with technical partners to understand the potential impact of this variant on our existing countermeasures, including vaccines.

Vaccines remain critical to reducing severe disease and death, including against the dominant circulating variant, Delta.

Current vaccines remain effective against severe disease and death.

Effectiveness of current tests: The widely used PCR tests continue to detect infection, including infection with Omicron, as we have seen with other variants as well.

Studies are ongoing to determine whether there is any impact on other types of tests, including rapid antigen detection tests.

Effectiveness of current treatments: Corticosteroids and IL6 Receptor Blockers will still be effective for managing patients with severe COVID-19.

Other treatments will be assessed to see if they are still as effective given the changes to parts of the virus in the Omicron variant.

At the present time, WHO is coordinating with a large number of researchers around the world to better understand Omicron.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 22 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Studies currently underway or underway shortly include assessments of transmissibility, severity of infection (including symptoms), performance of vaccines and diagnostic tests, and effectiveness of treatments.

WHO encourages countries to contribute the collection and sharing of hospitalized patient data through the WHO COVID-19 Clinical Data Platform to rapidly describe clinical characteristics and patient outcomes.

More information will emerge in the coming days and weeks.

WHO’s TAG-VE will continue to monitor and evaluate the data as it becomes available and assess how mutations in Omicron alter the behaviour of the virus.

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Q_3_Visit_https_wwwdatagovin_and_with_the_help_of_data_available_on_this_website_or_connected_websites_write_a_news_story_for_the_publication_like_Mention_the_data_sources_in_your_assignment"></span>Q 3\.

Ans: – The Omicron variant of COVID-19 has been called a variant of concern by WHO based on the evidence that it has several mutations that may have an impact on how it behaves.

There is still substantial uncertainty regarding Omicron and a lot of research underway to evaluate its transmissibility, severity and reinfection risk.

When a virus is circulating widely and causing numerous infections, the likelihood of the virus mutating increases.

The more opportunities a virus has to spread, the more opportunities it has to undergo changes.

New variants like Omicron are a reminder that the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 22 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

It is therefore essential that people get the vaccine when available to them and continue to follow existing advice on preventing the spread of the virus, including physical distancing, wearing masks, regular handwashing and keeping indoor areas well ventilated.

It is also crucial that vaccines and other public health measures are accessible everywhere.

Vaccine inequity leaves lower income countries – many of them in Africa – at the mercy of COVID-19.

Wellsupplied countries must urgently deliver the doses they promised.

Early findings suggest that Omicron might be less severe than the Delta variant, but more data is needed and WHO warns that it should not be dismissed as “mild”.

Studies are ongoing and this information will be updated as it becomes available.

It is important to remember that all variants of COVID-19 can cause severe disease or death, including the Delta variant that is still dominant worldwide,

which is why preventing the spread of the virus and reducing your risk of exposure to the virus is so important.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 22 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

India Records Over 90,000 New Covid Cases In 24 Hours

India reported 90,928 fresh COVID-19 cases on Thursday, over 56 per cent higher than the previous day’s cases.

In order to deal with the surge, the government is speeding up vaccination drives across the country. Those in the age group 15-18 are now being inoculated.

The number of deaths climbed to 4,82,876 with 325 more fatalities, the data showed.

A total of 2,630 cases of Omicron variant of coronavirus have been detected across 23 states and Union Territories so far, out of which 995 have recovered or migrated, according to the Union health ministry’s data updated on Wednesday.

Several states have announced restrictions like night curfew as Covid cases continue to rise.

Link :- https://www.mohfw.gov.in/

The Omicron tally in the country reached 2,630, with Maharashtra (797) topping the count, followed by Delhi (465), Rajasthan (236) and Kerala (234).

On Wednesday, the Centre confirmed the first Omicron-related death in the country — a 74-year-old man with comorbidities, who succumbed to the virus last week in Rajasthan’s Udaipur.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 22 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

India is witnessing an exponential rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, which is believed to be driven by the Omicron variant, the Centre said on Wednesday.

In a letter Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Jammu and Kashmir and Bihar, Additional Secretary of Union Health Ministry Arti Ahuja pointed out a considerable decline in Covid-19 testing amid rising cases and positivity rate and said it is a “cause of concern”.

Ans: – The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or Global Goals are a collection of 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a “blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all”.

The SDGs were set up in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly (UN-GA) and are intended to be achieved by the year 2030.

They are included in a UN-GA Resolution called the 2030 Agenda or what is colloquially known as Agenda 2030.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 22 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

The SDGs were developed in the Post-2015 Development Agenda as the future global development framework to succeed the Millennium Development Goals which ended in 2015.

The 17 SDGs are: (1) No Poverty, (2) Zero Hunger, (3) Good Health and Well-being, (4) Quality Education, (5) Gender Equality, (6) Clean Water and Sanitation, (7) Affordable and Clean Energy, (8) Decent Work and Economic Growth, (9) Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, (10) Reduced Inequality, (11) Sustainable Cities and Communities, (12) Responsible Consumption and Production, (13) Climate Action, (14) Life Below Water, (15) Life On Land, (16) Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions, (17) Partnerships for the Goals.

Though the goals are broad and interdependent, two years later the SDGs were made more “actionable” by a UN Resolution adopted by the General Assembly.

The resolution identifies specific targets for each goal, along with indicators that are being used to measure progress toward each target.

The year by which the target is meant to be achieved is usually between 2020 and 2030\. For some of the targets, no end date is given.

**NO POVERTY SDG** <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 22 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Globally, the number of people living in extreme poverty declined from 36 per cent in 1990 to 10 per cent in 2015.

But the pace of change is decelerating and the COVID-19 crisis risks reversing decades of progress in the fight against poverty.

New research published by the UNU World Institute for Development Economics Research warns that the economic fallout from the global pandemic could increase global poverty by as much as half a billion people, or 8% of the total human population.

This would be the first time that poverty has increased globally in thirty years, since 1990.

More than 700 million people, or 10 per cent of the world population, still live in extreme poverty today, struggling to fulfil the most basic needs like health, education, and access to water and sanitation, to name a few.

The majority of people living on less than $1.90 a day live in sub-Saharan Africa.

Worldwide, the poverty rate in rural areas is 17.2 per cent—more than three times higher than in urban areas.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 22 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

For those who work, having a job does not guarantee a decent living. In fact, 8 per cent of employed workers and their families worldwide lived in extreme poverty in 2018\. One out of five children live in extreme poverty.

Ensuring social protection for all children and other vulnerable groups is critical to reduce poverty.

A sustainably managed environment is a prerequisite for socio-economic development and poverty reduction.

The natural environment supplies ecosystem goods and services that provide income, support job creation, poverty alleviation, contribute to safety nets and reduce inequity.

Climate change and exposure to natural disasters threaten to derail efforts to eradicate poverty.

A great bulk of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable citizens live in disaster prone countries and their number keeps increasing.

Those groups are disproportionally affected by shocks and stresses.

As temperatures rise, the likelihood and severity of climate-related disasters increase affecting lives and livelihoods, hampering the development efforts and reversing gains made in poverty reduction.

Targets linked to the environment : <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 22 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Target 1.5: By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters.

India and Goal 1 :

Global reduction in extreme poverty was driven mainly by Asia – notably China and India.

Between 2005-06 and 2015-16, the incidence of multidimensional poverty in India was almost halved, climbing down to 27.5 percent from 54.7 percent as per the 2018 global Multidimensional Poverty Index report.

Within ten years, the number of poor people in India fell by more than 271 million (from 635 million to 364 million).

Traditionally disadvantaged subgroups such as rural dwellers, scheduled castes and tribes, Muslims, and young children are still the poorest in 2015-16.

However, the biggest reductions in multidimensional poverty has been witnessed among the poorest and traditionally disadvantaged groups – across states, castes, religions and age-groups. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 22 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Multidimensional poverty among children under 10 has fallen the fastest.

In 2005-06 there were 292 million poor children in India, so the latest figures represent a 47 percent decrease or a 136 million fewer children growing up in multidimensional poverty.

The Government of India has many progressive schemes, including the world’s largest employment guarantee scheme, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, and the National Social Assistance Programme.

**Targets :**

➢ By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than USD1.25 a day.

➢ By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions.

➢ Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.

➢ By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance.

➢ By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate- related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters.

➢ Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions.

➢ Create sound policy frameworks at the national, regional and international levels, based on pro-poor and gender-sensitive development strategies, to support accelerated investment in poverty eradication actions.

PM Security Breach, Supreme Court Hearing Tomorrow :

The Supreme Court has been asked to hold the Punjab Chief Secretary and the Director-General of Police responsible and suspend them pending action. “It has to be ensured this doesn’t happen again,” the petitioner said.

Chief Justice NV Ramana told the petitioner to file a copy with the state and said the issue would be heard tomorrow.

The Punjab government – under fire from the BJP with an election due next month – set up a twomember panel. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 22 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Justice Mehtab Gill, a retired judge, and Anurag Verma, Principal Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs, will submit a report within three days.

President Ram Nath Kovind met Prime Minister Modi at Rashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi.  
The President received a first-hand account of the incident, his Twitter account said, adding that the President also expressed his concerns over the security lapse.

The BJP has released what it claims are internal memos of Punjab Police directing its officers to make “necessary security, traffic and route arrangements” for the Prime Minister’s visit.

These memos, the BJP claims, also warn of last-minute plan changes due to bad weather and that “farmers are likely to hold dharnas… may result in roadblocks… please make necessary diversion plans”.

A massive row broke out Wednesday when PM Modi, who was on his way to Ferozepur for an election rally, was stopped for 20 minutes on a flyover.

His convoy – he was travelling the 100 km from Bathinda to the rally by road after bad weather grounded his helicopter – was blocked by protesting farmers. He was stopped 10 km from the venue.

This morning the Home Ministry criticised Punjab Police for failing to prepare a contingency route for the PM’s visit, in line with protocol.

This was necessary given existing intel about protesting farmers in the area, a ministry official said.

Normally the SPG remains near the PM while state police sanitise routes and check for threats. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 22 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Questions have been raised, however, over the events that led to the convoy getting stuck on that flyover.

This includes the big point – why was he on an unsanitised route? Why did the PM’s security detail agree to a road trip if there was intel about protesting farmers, and did the police clear (did they get enough time?) the proposed route?

Union Minister Smriti Irani has led the chorus of political attacks on the Congress, accusing the party of “a murderous conspiracy to kill the PM”.

“The Congress hates him, now they want to harm him,” she declared, upping the ante ahead of the February-March election.

The Congress has hit back by asking if protocol was followed in this case.

Party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala pointed out that elaborate arrangements had been made but the route the Prime Minister was on was not part of the original schedule.

Chief Minister Channi, whom BJP chief JP Nadda accused of deliberately not fielding SOS calls, has refuted any such charge.

“As a Punjabi, I would die to protect you (the Prime Minister) …but there was no danger to his life. There was no security breach,” he stressed.

Telangana BJP Chief Released From Jail After High Court Order :

BJP’s Telangana unit president and MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar, who was arrested two days ago for alleged violation of COVID-19 prohibitory orders over a protest, walked out of the jail on Wednesday after the Telangana High Court ordered his release.

Talking to reporters after being released from the jail at Karimnagar, Mr Kumar vowed to continue the fight against the government order (GO) for the sake of teachers and other government employees and others.

Asserting that he is undeterred by his imprisonment, he said he was jailed while fighting for the cause of teachers and government employees and not because of any unscrupulous reasons. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 22 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

He demanded that the state government amend the GO.

The BJP leader was arrested on Sunday night for alleged violation of COVID-19-related prohibitory orders in connection with a protest against the GO.

Alleging corruption by the ruling TRS, he asserted that his party would fight against it.

Earlier in the day, on a petition filed by Sanjay Kumar, the High Court directed that he be released on furnishing a personal bond.

How spike in fuel prices led to Kazakhstan govt’s resignation :

A sharp and sudden spike in fuel prices triggered a national crisis in Kazakhstan, with the government officially stepping down on Tuesday, following days of violent protests across the country.

Kazakh security forces on Thursday said that dozens of protestors and at least eight law enforcement officials were killed during an operation to restore order in the main city, Almaty, BBC reported.

Russia has sent in troops to assist security personnel in their efforts to restore order in the country. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 22 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev requested the support of the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a military alliance, comprising Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.

On Tuesday, Tokayev declared a two-week state of emergency in Almaty as well as the western Mangistau province, where thousands of protesters have been seen storming government buildings and clashing with the police officials.

Internet services were promptly shut off and messaging apps were banned.

Australia bars Novak Djokovic, cancels entry visa :

World number one tennis player Novak Djokovic was denied entry into Australia on Thursday amid a storm of protest about a decision to grant him a medical exemption from COVID-19 vaccination requirements to play in the Australian Open.

The tennis star was transported to a quarantine hotel in Melbourne after being held at the city’s airport overnight and was told he would be removed from the country later on Thursday, a source close to the tournament told Reuters.

The saga, fuelled by domestic political point-scoring about the country’s handling of a record surge in new COVID-19 infections, created an international incident with the Serbian president claiming harassment of its star player.

Australia’s Border Force confirmed Djokovic’s visa had been revoked, while the source said the player’s lawyers planned to file an injunction to prevent his removal.

“There are no special cases, rules are rules,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said at a televised media briefing.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 22 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

“We will continue to make the right decisions when it comes to securing Australian borders in relation to this pandemic,” Morrison said.

Djokovic, who has consistently refused to disclose his vaccination status while publicly criticising mandatory vaccines, kicked off the furore when he said on Instagram that he had received a medical exemption to pursue a record-breaking 21st Grand Slam win at the Open starting January 17.

The announcement prompted outcry in Australia, particularly in tournament host city of Melbourne, which has endured the world’s longest cumulative lockdown to ward off the coronavirus.

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Q_1_What_is_sound_effect_Discuss_the_importance_of_sound_effects_in_radio_programmes"></span>**Q 1\. What is sound effect? Discuss the importance of sound effects in radio programmes.**<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

Ans: – Sound effects (typically digital in nature, living as a file on a computer) are recorded and edited, or synthesized artificially for use in some medium.

This medium could be a theatrical play, film, television broadcast, radio broadcast, podcast, video game, application, or any other medium that can facilitate the playback of a digital sound file.

<div class="code-block code-block-14" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;"><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>

Sound effects can also be of analog or acoustical nature and originally arose in use in early theatrical plays, providing an additional story-telling element (ex. a large metal sheet replicating the sound of thunder during a loud storm).

Various special microphones, like hydrophones and contact microphones, allow sound recordists to capture frequencies present in places humans may not ordinarily be able to listen, and may not be able to record with traditional microphones.

Every microphone has a different capability in terms of frequency response, maximum Sound Pressure Level (loudness) and internal noise.

Knowing how and when to use the different microphones available is important to the capturing of sound effects.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 23 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Every sound effect will sound different depending on how it’s recorded, making the need for an expansive collection of SFX prevalent when working on a large project like a film, television show, or video game.

Some sound engineers specialize in recording sound effects and focus solely on this aspect of sound.

For instance, Soundsnap is a sound effects library that contains thousands of sound effects from various contributing recordists.

Sound effects in a radio programme give meaning and sense of location. It adds realism to a programme and helps a listener to use imagination.

Sound effects describe the circumstances of a dramatic audio situation.

They can be used for such things as setting and place, conveying action, solving certain narrative problems and evoking characteristics.

Effects should sound as though they were being heard by the character. Dubbing adds extra sound effects or bring disparate sounds together.

Sound effects can be used in two ways:

(a) Spot effects or effects that are created as we speak and

(b) Recorded sound effects.

**Categories of Sound Effects:** <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 23 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

a) Ambiences: It provide a sense of place, “where”, and perhaps of time “when”, events occur.

b) Discrete Effects: Indicates individual events; “what”, “how”, and “how much”.

c) Crowds: Sounds of many people in a crowded situation, without specific voices or words being distinguishable.

d) Dialogue: Dialogue is sound too. The character of the voice indicates a lot about who the character is. Give importance to vocal contrast.

e) Silence: A dramatic element.

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Q_2_Write_a_script_for_a_television_news_package_of_90_seconds_duration_on_any_story_related_to_pollution"></span>**Q 2\. Write a script for a television news package of 90 seconds duration on any story related to pollution.**<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

**Ans:** – For too long, we have been exploiting and destroying our planet’s ecosystems.

Every three seconds, the world loses enough forest to cover a football pitch and over the last century we have& destroyed half of our& wetlands.

As much as 50 per cent of our coral reefs have already been lost and up to 90 per cent of coral reefs could be lost by 2050, even if global warming is limited to an increase of 1.5°C. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 23 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Ecosystem loss is depriving the world of carbon sinks, like forests and peatlands, at a time humanity can least afford it.

Global greenhouse gas emissions have grown for three consecutive years and the planet is one pace for potentially catastrophic climate change.

The emergence of COVID-19 has also shown just how disastrous the consequences of ecosystem loss can be.

By shrinking the area of natural habitat for animals, we have created ideal conditions for pathogens – including coronaviruses – to spread.

With this big and challenging picture, the World Environment Day is focus in the ecosystem restoration and its theme is “Reimagine.Recreate.Restore.”

Ecosystem restoration means preventing, halting and reversing this damage – to go from exploiting nature to healing it.

This World Environment Day will kick off the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030), a global mission to revive billions of hectares, from forests to farmlands, from the top of mountains to the depth of the sea.

Only with healthy ecosystems can we enhance people’s livelihoods, counteract climate change and stop the collapse of biodiversity.

From forests to peatlands to coasts, we all depend on healthy ecosystems for our survival. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 23 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Ecosystems are defined as the interaction between living organisms – plants, animals, people – with their surroundings.

This includes nature, but also human-made systems such as cities or farms.

Ecosystem restoration is a global undertaking at massive scale.

It means repairing billions of hectares of land – an area greater than China or the USA – so that people have access to food, clean water and jobs.

It means bringing back plants and animals from the brink of extinction, from the peaks of mountains to the depths of the sea.

But it also includes the many small actions everyone can take, every day: growing trees, greening our cities, rewilding our gardens or cleaning up trash alongside rivers and coasts.

Restoring ecosystems carries substantial benefits for people. For every dollar invested in restoration, at least seven to thirty dollars in returns for society can be expected.

Restoration also creates jobs in rural areas where they are most needed.

Some countries have already invested in restoration as part of their strategies to bounce back from COVID-19.

Others are turning to restoration to help them adapt to a climate that is already changing.

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Q_3_Describe_the_structure_and_functioning_of_a_television_newsroom"></span>**Q 3\. Describe the structure and functioning of a television newsroom.**<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

Ans: – In Journalism, there is always a room or space that provides reporters, directors, editors and news broadcasters with an avenue to do their jobs effectively.

The Newsroom structure is one of those environments. In Mass media and communication studies, these professionals are given a central space to get jobs done.

A newsroom structure is that central workspace in a media house where editors, news reporters, directors and producers come together to publish news, be it on a magazine, newspaper, over a radio or on a television.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 23 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

It could be a live shoot or a recording. In journalism, the process of broadcasting news is usually a team effort, it involves the effort of every member of staff.

In the newsroom which is also called the City room, there is the need for all the professionals to collectively bring a story to life.

There different sets of people who work to see that news are published. There are a set of people called gatekeepers.

This set of people tend to come in really handy when there has to be a regular news broadcast, either print or on media.

On the other hand, when there has to be a publishing of a news online, the services of the gatekeepers may not be as required.

There are basically two types of a newsroom. There is a news room for Broadcasting and there is equally a news room for newspaper.

Though they have similarities, the striking difference between the two newsrooms is that these rooms both have other spaces within them, where the editing of videos and audios are done.

The news room and the newspaper room also happen to be close by the radio and television studio.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 23 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

In a newspaper or print publication room, reporters are expected to sit at the desks being provided, collate information, news, stories to be reported and send over to the news editors for review, a final compilation and depending on the case, to be rewritten.

The structure of a newsroom depends partly on the size and time of a particular publication.

If there has to be a publication on a daily basis. The size of a newsroom can also play a large role in the functions of a news room at a said time.

Most times, a newspaper publication is done in the early hours of the day. There is always a budget meeting held by the editors of a media house.

Here, the editors decide what part of a newspaper will contain every story.

They decide what stories have the catchiest headlines and whether or not which story should be placed on the front page of a newspaper publication.

In a newsroom, there is always a desk which is popularly called an “Assignment desk” by the journalists. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 23 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

This desk serves as the position where staff members tend to attend to calls, emails, and respond to emergency reports.

The assignment desk in the newsroom also serves as the point where different stories and headlines are assigned to broadcasters or reporters by the editors.

On the assignment desk, some stories are also taken away from the list, it is decided whether a story or news will be aired.

In the newsroom, the assignment desk is usually placed higher or above, as in a platform or a stage, to enable other members of the crew to attend to the reporters on the seat.

It is also placed that way because reporters need to see staff members and call their attention whenever there is a need for that.

The structure of a contemporary newsroom also allows for a system called the Maestro concept.

The Maestro concept in the newsroom is a system that gives reporters in the media house an avenue to manage time and improve time management when reporting.

This maestro concept is usually an effort of the entire team, to keep the reporters abreast of time.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 23 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

The maestro concept is usually set as a system in the Broadcasting newsroom and is an important part of the newsroom structure.

The broadcasting of news by reporters or broadcasters seeks the attention of an entire team because it takes a large number of professionals in the field to bring a story or report to life.

When there are unison, synchrony and teamwork in the reporting of a story, the pictures, plot and every detailed information of a story is presented in its best form.

The structure of a newsroom is usually large and requires all the necessary equipment to enable quality production and participation of the members of staff.

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Q_4_What_is_interactivity_Explain_interactivity_as_one_of_the_main_characteristics_of_online_journalism"></span>**Q 4\. What is interactivity? Explain ‘interactivity’ as one of the main characteristics of online journalism.**<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

Ans: – Interactivity is the communication process that takes place between humans and computer software.

The most constant form of interactivity is typically found in games, which need a continuous form of interactivity with the gamer.

Database applications and other financial, engineering and trading applications are also typically very interactive.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 23 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

There are many software packages that run in the background without any need for input from humans or output to them — that is, with no interactivity.

A web browser is a common interactive program that most people deal with. During an online session, the web browser is the only interactive application that the user deals with.

The code included in every Internet page defines a degree of interactivity with the user.

For example, an online form needs input from a user and then it gives output in the form of labels that indicate the data to be entered in each text box or lists for the user to choose from.

Web based applications offer many forms of interactivity, including hypertext, which adds an embedded link to a text.

Such interactivity provides higher readability and expands online applications to include video, audio and games.

The four identities types of online journalism to some extent utilize the key characteristics which include hypertextualiy, multimediality, interactivity, and immediacy.

Each of these four characteristics make-up online journalism in their own way, I will try to exemplify by looking at the online news situation.

**Hypertextuality :** <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 23 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

The problem with hypertext is as one of the founding fathers of hypertext Ted Nelson writes, that it creates “a delivery system for separate closed units – a system which allows only embedded links pointing outwards”.

What one has to realize is that texts, interconnected through links – hyperlinks – can refer internally to the other texts within text’s domain or externally to texts located elsewhere on the internet.

Effective use of internal and external hyperlinks is a basic element of a good online media production.

It enables journalists to refer their readers to all kinds of background or related information, ranging over documents, illustrations, sources, multiple perspectives on a particular topic and so on.

If we examine how today’s news sites apply these concepts the conclusion we will come up with is pessimistic.

Only a few sites actually embed hyperlinks and if they do it does not integrate their information with the web.

**Multimediality :**

Multimediality means the extent to which text, graphics, sound, voice and images (still and moving) are translated and integrated into a common digital form.

The internet provides opportunity to journalists to present non-linear types of storytelling by using hypertextuality and multimediality in an innovative way.

One of the important implications of multimedia is that the online journalist will learn how to work with these different formats.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 23 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

For this writing, the journalist will also need the skills to decide for each story that which part of parts of the story will consist of text and which one will carry audio and visual elements.

Web designer Tim Guay has written as early as 1995 about the inherent pitfalls of applying multimedia content to web sites: “if multimedia is used with no thought to the reasons why it is being used, or it had poor lay-out or content it can result in a pointless aesthetic fiasco that needlessly hogs bandwidth”.

I**nteractivity :**

Interactivity is the process of two people or things working together and influencing each other that is the ability of a computer to respond to a user’s input.

In online journalism interactivity is subdivided into three types: navigational interactivity, functional interactivity, and adaptive interactivity.

Observing interactive options in news sites it is noted that there is a sheer absence or rather the fact that most sites do not develop interactivity beyond functional and navigational levels.

The most sophisticated level of interactivity is adaptive meaning that it allows the web site to adapt to itself, and the behaviour of the visiting surfer.

Its revealed that the more interactive opportunities websites give to users, the more involved the users will feel about the website.

Mainstream news sites usually operate on internal hypertextuality with mainly navigate interactivity.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 23 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

These sites don’t usually apply multimedia, unless they specifically intend to index images.

This could be seen as serving as some kind of accountability one could argue: allowing the surfer to submit a feedback or comment to the people responsible for the metasite.

**Immediacy :**

Immediacy is the quality of bringing into direct and instant involvement with something, giving rise to a sense of urgency or excitement.

The basic concept of immediacy is that it means there is theory, virtually no lag between when information is received or created at a news producer and when the information is passed on to the news consumers.

This is possible because of two related features.

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Q_5_Explain_any_four_of_the_following_terms"></span>**Q 5\. Explain any four of the following terms:**<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

### <span class="ez-toc-section" id="i_Voiceover_Artist"></span>i**. Voiceover Artist**<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

Ans: – Recorded voices are all around us. In fact, most people are so accustomed to hearing human voices integrated into their favorite products, spaces, and services that they might never stop to ask the obvious question: whose voice am I hearing?

The answer, of course, is that of a voiceover artist.

The center of a massive and rapidly expanding industry, voiceover artists are professional actors who use their voices to create characters, tell stories, communicate vital information, and connect with customers.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 23 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Every day new performers flock to this popular career—attracted by the flexible, workfrom-home lifestyle or the dream of voicing the next Disney-Pixar film—and yet demand for voiceover only seems to grow,

as new work flows in from successful internet markets like the audiobook, online education, and phone app industries.

Some may mourn the tight-knit communities, energetic studio sessions, and slower pace that characterized the pre-internet industry, but for the most part, there’s never been a better time to be a voiceover artist.

A voiceover is a form of acting, but that doesn’t mean that any actor can work in the voice industry.

Many of the things “regular” actors rely on—facial expressions, movements, sets, costumes, props— are not an option in a purely auditory medium. For voiceover artists, who typically work on projects

in a wide variety of genres, every job requires a different skill set and a unique approach.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 23 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Reading an audiobook, for example, necessitates excellent diction and a steady reading voice, while voicing a video game might call for shouts, gasps, and grunts—non-speaking cues delivered under the direction of a dialogue editor.

Commercial is the broadest category of voiceover work, as a good commercial performance might be naturalistic, exaggeratedly theatrical, or even cartoonish depending on the material and direction.

Some voiceover artists have very particular specialties, such as mimics, who excel at imitating famous actors and characters and are often hired to record ADR for those who are unavailable—a difficult task which requires matching the delivery to the actor’s on-screen mouth movements.

At times, as when using motion capture technology, the line between voiceover artist and actor can grow blurry.

### <span class="ez-toc-section" id="ii_Anchor-Graphics"></span>**ii. Anchor-Graphics**<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

Ans: – For twenty years, Anchor provided free classes for high school students, and had an outreach program called Press on Wheels (POW) which brought printmaking into schools, galleries, museums, and community centers.

Workshops were open to students of all ages who learned to create handmade prints.

During the Toulouse-Lautrec and Rembrandt exhibitions at the Art Institute of Chicago, a press was brought to the museum, and Anchor staff demonstrated the print processes and tools used by both artists.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 23 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Ann Weins writes in DEMO 3, pages 24–28: “Anchor Graphics maintains an impressive schedule of classes, workshops, residencies, and lectures, all the while publishing exquisite, hand-pulled prints.”

The Artist-in-Residence Program was created to provide uninterrupted use of the shop by national and international printmakers for research and the development of new work.

Scraping the Surface free lecture series open to the public, presented talks by artists, curators, museum specialists, conservators, collectors, and others with an interest in prints, and was funded by the Terra Foundation for American Art from 2006 – 2010

### <span class="ez-toc-section" id="iii_MCR"></span>**iii. MCR**<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

Ans: – MCR stands for Master Control Room, the technical hub of a broadcast operation, where the signals from both audio and video pass through prior to transmission.

An MCR Operator works within the MCR on equipment which might typically include video monitors, satellite receivers, video tape machines and transmission equipment.

They check the quality of content, ensuring the transmission meets government regulations and respond to any technical issues from other areas of the operation.

Regulations include content ones (such as station ID, indecency, watershed rules etc.) and technical regulations (including those against over-modulation and “dead air”).

### <span class="ez-toc-section" id="iv_Shifted_time"></span>i**v. Shifted time**<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

Ans: – In broadcasting, time shifting is the recording of programming to a storage medium to be viewed or listened to after the live broadcasting.

Typically, this refers to TV programming but can also refer to radio shows via podcasts. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 23 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

In recent years, the advent of the digital video recorder (DVR) has made time shifting easier, by using an electronic program guide (EPG) and recording shows onto a hard disk.

Some DVRs have other possible time shifting methods, such as being able to start watching the recorded show from the beginning even if the recording is not yet complete.

In the past, time shifting was done with a video cassette recorder (VCR) and its timer function, in which the VCR tunes into the appropriate station and records the show onto video tape.

Certain broadcasters transmit timeshifted versions of their channels, usually carrying programming from one hour in the past, to enable those without recording abilities to resolve conflicts and those with recording abilities more flexibility in scheduling conflicting recordings.

### <span class="ez-toc-section" id="v_Open_Source_Reporting"></span>**v. Open Source Reporting**<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

Ans:- Though businesses opt for open-source software (OSS) primarily because they’re cost-effective, embeddability and regular updates are added benefits.

Many software vendors offer open-source solutions as a trial run for companies to upgrade to the paid version later.

Open-source is a software development term that refers to the public accessibility of an application’s source code.

Programmers who write the source code can manipulate it to improve how the application functions; it’s usually hidden from regular users – this is the definition of proprietary software.

Only the agency or person who created the code has exclusive control and modification rights.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 23 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Remember agreeing to a license agreement when using software for the first time?  
This agreement states you won’t make any changes to the software that its authors haven’t permitted.

Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop are examples of proprietary software.

On the other hand, non-proprietary software authors make the code freely available to others for using, copying, updating and sharing.

Chromium and Android are open-source. BIRT, JReport and Microsoft Power BI are some open-source reporting solutions.

With OSS, you also have to agree to specific license terms – you can use the software, with the stipulation that in case of any modifications, you must make the source code public, free of cost.

Ans: – Mass media does not operate in a vacuum; the press always takes on the form and coloration of the social and political structures within which it operates.

Normative theories were first proposed by Fred, Peterson and Wilbur Schramm in their book called “Four Theories of the Press”.

<div class="code-block code-block-14" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;"><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>

At first the word “Normative Theory” was pronounced in USA during the height of ‘cold war’ with communism and soviet. Often it called as western theories of mass media.

A Normative theory describes an ideal way for a media system to be controlled and operated by the government, authority, leader and public.

These theories are basically different from other communication theories because normative theories of press are not providing any scientific explanations or prediction.

At the same these “four theories of the press” came from many sources rather than a single source.

Sometimes media practitioners, social critics and academics also involved to develop these normative theories.

Normative theories are more focused in the relationship between Press and the Government than press and the audience.

These theories are more concern about the ownership of the media and who controls the press or media in the country. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 24 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

By contrast, normative statements affirm how things should or ought to be, how to value them, which things are good or bad.

Normative theories are divided into the following categories:

Long before the democratic societies could think of matters pertaining to freedom of speech,

there existed a thought that the emergence of media should not challenge the writ of the government which were more in dictatorial form and less they looked like democracies.<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 24 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

The media was forced to remain under state control. It had following features which, in non-democratic governments still rule on media:

a) Direct governmental control of the media. Typical to pre-democratic societies, where the government consists of very small ruling-class.

b) No printing that could undermine the established authority or offense to existing political set up.

c) The government may punish anyone who questions the state’s ideology and the Media professionals are not allowed to have any independence within the media organization.

d) Registration of the media by the state.

This theory developed in the 16th and 17th centuries and was mainly based on absolute power of the monarchy (truth).

It was essential that the Press supports monarchy and couldn’t criticise it.

This approach was designed to protect the established social order, setting clear limits to media freedom and ensure that it is not the media which must talk about people and their problems in any manner.

According to this theory, mass media, though not under the direct control of the State, had to follow its bidding.

This Theory Envisages:

i. The government consists of a very limited and small ruling-class and media are not allowed to print or broadcast anything which could undermine the established authority of the government. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 24 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

ii. Any offense to the existing political values should be avoided and the government may punish anyone who questions the state’s ideology.

iii. The government is infallible and the media professionals are therefore not allowed to have any independence within the media organization.

iv. Foreign media are subordinate to the established authority, in that all imported media products are controlled by the state.

Steps were taken to control the freedom of expression. The result was advocacy of complete dictatorship.

The theory promoted zealous obedience to a hierarchical superior and reliance on threat and punishment to those who did not follow the censorship rules or did not respect authority.

Censorship of the press was justified on the ground that the State always took precedence over the individual’s right to freedom of expression.

This theory stemmed from the authoritarian philosophy of Plato (407 – 327 B.C), who thought that the State was safe only in the hands of a few wise men.

Thomas Hobbes (1588 – 1679), a British academician, argued that the power to maintain order was sovereign and individual objections were to be ignored.

Engel, a German thinker further reinforced the theory by stating that freedom came into its supreme right only under Authoritarianism.

The world has been witness to authoritarian means of control over media by both dictatorial and democratic governments.

This theory essentially applies to authoritarian societies, but can surface in less authoritarian societies (particularly in times of war, terrorism).

It depends on the medium/ media of press subject to a greater control in some countries. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 24 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

There are certain assumptions attached to the Authoritarian approach, which are as follows:

a) Press should do nothing to undermine vested power and interests;

b) Press should be subordinate to vested power and authority;

c) Press should avoid acting in contravention of prevailing moral and political values;

d) Censorship justified in the application of these principles;

e) Criminalisation of editorial attacks on vested power, deviations from official policy, violation of moral codes.

f) Media is an instrument/ mouthpiece to publicise and propagandise government ideology and actions.

g) Absolute power of state versus subservience of the individual ᾶ press.

These assumptions in turn help us in understanding the basic premise of the theory.  
It explains the principles on which this theory is based and the approach which the authoritarian society used to follow.

The biggest examples of this theory are: Fascist regimes, some African countries, communist countries, Aspects of apartheid etc.

Closely observe a newspaper/a news channel of your choice for a fortnight. ………………………………. And trace the newspaper/news channel’s efforts to air public concerns on that coverage.<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

**Ans:** – Labeled as the “fourth estate” in democratic societies, the media possesses a distinctive capability to influence and shape government policies.

Normatively ascribed the role of a “watchdog” with a capacity to contribute to institutional change, the media holds the political elite accountable, reflects the needs of the audience, and exposes transgressions of the power holders within the democratic system.

Its role thus in influencing matters related to legislation and government policies is crucial and should not be overlooked.

Media’s origin is usually traced back to the French Revolution that witnessed an uprising of the press. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 24 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Since then, the media has been used as a powerful tool in mending governmental policies and establishing free societies.

Although it does not own the authority to “create” policies, it plays an instrumental role in exercising decisive influence over the general public’s policy priorities.

This is achieved by the media’s omnipresent role as a mediator between the State and Society, actively participating in the public representation of policies, thereby also acting as the gatekeeper of the agenda of political discourse.

Correspondingly, policy proposals are designed by the politicians anticipating the media reaction.

This has increasingly strengthened the reciprocal power dynamics between the two.

While dealing with the dissemination of government information, the media also plays the crucial role of a stakeholder in times of crisis,

wherein it informs the public regarding the crisis escalation, and the news is framed through a ‘self-referential cycle’, that includes interactions between the media, the public, and policyholders.

However, in this cycle, these parties may project their perceptions of reality onto the news.

As a result, during adverse situations, Indian media lacks the independence to present critical perspectives and investigative reports.

**Progressive Developments** <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 24 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

The Indian media’s coverage of the price hike that followed the 2008 global food crisis, pressurized the government into introducing targeted strategies and policies to insulate the poor and vulnerable from the price shock.

Submitting to panic, the government devised various measures like food stock to be sold at subsidized rates along with a public distribution system.

It curbed the escalation through the imposition of export tariffs coupled with higher domestic price support of crops.

The media thus triggered some well-calibrated policy formulations that helped the domestic market remain stable and restricted the overall food inflation.

Studies have also revealed the determining influence of the media on foreign policy matters.

On the issue of signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which would ban all types of nuclear explosions,

the political parties in India were divided on the opinions, especially when the agreement got linked with the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty.

India felt that the Treaty was essentially discriminatory and posed a threat to its sovereignty and so the majority opined that it should not be signed.

The debates in Indian newspapers called for a rejection of the treaty, and this ultimately inspired the government’s final stance.

**Recognition of Rights: Raising the Bar**

The Delhi Gang Rape Case (Nirbhaya Case, 2012) was one of the most sensitive issues where investigative journalism catalyzed the public outrage and stimulated debates around the need for social reforms. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 24 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

The increasing momentum placed this case on the priority list of the Indian policy, which eventually resulted in various amendments in Criminal Law.

Here, the media provided a platform to debate the existing policies and pressurized the Centre to formulate stringent laws and regulations for women.

Mathura’s rape case led to amendments in rape laws and a re-development of the concept of ‘consent’ in rape cases.

The widespread dissent amongst people during the Bhanwari Devi rape case culminated in the landmark Vishakha Judgement.

The recently introduced Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act significantly furthered legal recognition for transgender individuals as the ‘Third Gender’ under the Indian Constitution.

In this manner, the media acts as the primary conduit between the public and policymakers, legitimizing the general opinion by addressing the same to the government institutions.

Media effectively brings into cognizance different instances that require government intervention in the form of policies.

The campaign #blacklivesmatter gained momentum as the video of Police torture on George Floyd went viral by the media. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 24 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

In the Indian context, this case forced Indians to introspect about the inherent caste system in society.

The recent images of Kerala’s elephant, that died due to the firecrackers in the fruit, reprimands the actions of humans and calls for government intervention to make stringent legislation on animal rights.

The incident of the Boys Locker Room has forced the government to materialize the laws on cyber-crimes concerning juveniles.

The images of the dilapidated plight of the migrant laborers circulated by the media have led the governments to introduce reforms in the labor laws.

What had been expected to be a tense chase on the fourth day became a comfortable win for the home side after rain delayed the start of play by almost six hours.

When play did get under way after tea it was under heavily overcast skies with the floodlights on. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 24 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Resuming at 118 for two in pursuit of a target of 240, Elgar and Rassie van der Dussen added 57 runs in the first hour before Van der Dussen was caught behind off Mohammed Shami for 40.

The pair had put on 82 for the third wicket.

Temba Bavuma gave a caught and bowled chance to Shardul Thakur before he had scored but then batted solidly to make 23 not out and stay with Elgar until the end.

The captain was not quite able to complete his century but hit the winning runs with a flick for four off Ravichandran Ashwin.

The decider in the three-match series will start at Newlands in Cape Town on Tuesday.

The Centre Thursday formed a three-member committee to enquire into “serious lapses” in security arrangements during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Punjab which led to the exposure of the VVIP to grave risk.

The Home Ministry panel was formed a day after Modi had to cut short his visit in Punjab after he was stuck on a flyover for 20 minutes due to a blockade by some protesters, an incident described by the Ministry of Home Affairs as a “major lapse” in security. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 24 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

The MHA has also sought an immediate report from the state government besides asking it to fix responsibility and take strict action against those responsible.

“Ministry of Home Affairs(MHA) has constituted a committee to enquire into the serious lapses in the security arrangements during Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s visit to Ferozepur, Punjab on 05.01.2022,which led to the exposure of the VVIP to grave security risk,” a spokesperson tweeted.

Fresh violence erupted in Kazakhstan’s main city on Thursday after Russia rushed in paratroopers to put down a countrywide uprising in one of Moscow’s closest former Soviet allies.

Police in the main city Almaty said they had killed dozens of rioters overnight into the early hours of Thursday morning.

The authorities said at least 18 members of the security forces had died, including two found decapitated. More than 2,000 people had been arrested.

After a night of running confrontations between protesters and troops on the streets, a presidential residence in the city and its mayor’s office were both ablaze, and burnt out cars littered the city. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 24 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Advisory Board for Banking and Financial Frauds (ABBFF), which might now look at financial institution frauds of Rs 3 crore and above and advocate motion.

Till now, the ABBFF was solely trying into banking and monetary frauds of Rs 50 crore and above.

With the above modification, there can be full synchronisation of all of the frauds the place complaints/FIRs are filed with CBI for the brink of Rs 3 crore and above, an official assertion stated.

“CVC in consultation with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Department of Financial Services has further expanded the role of ABBFF headed by T M Bhasin, former vigilance commissioner,

to cover all banking and financial fraud cases involving the amount of Rs 3 crore and above, to examine the role of all levels of officials/Whole Time Directors (including exofficials/ex-WTDs) in Public Sector Banks (PSBs) and Public Sector Financial Institutions (PSFIs),” it stated.

In terms of transmissibility, we are seeing a really increased growth rate of Omicron over other variants of concern.

These are some of the sharpest increases that we’ve seen to date. We do know that it has what we call a growth advantage over Delta.

And what this means is that we’re seeing a large increase in cases where Omicron is detected.

At the time of filming this Omicron has been detected in more than 77 countries, but it’s likely that it’s present in other countries as well.

The big question right now is how will Omicron compete with other variants that are circulating in populations? For example, will Omicron outcompete Delta or not? It’s still a little bit early for us to have a full understanding,

but what we can say is that some of the mutations that are identified in Omicron will provide a growth advantage, will allow it to be more transmissible.

So, this is a concern that we have and as we know, more cases, if there’s more increased transmissibility, which is what we are seeing, we’ll have more cases.

More cases mean more hospitalizations and more hospitalizations can put health care systems that are already overburdened into a state where people will not get the appropriate care that they need. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 24 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Holding the Charanjit Singh Channi government squarely responsible for the gross security lapse during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Punjab that eventually led to cancellation of all his programmes yesterday,

former Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh has demanded dismissal of the government and imposition of President’s rule in the state.

In a statement issued at Chandigarh, the former Chief Minister said, “this government has lost all the moral and constitutional authority to continue in office as it failed in its constitutional duty to provide security to our Prime Minister”.

He said, by trying to deflect the issue and claim that it was a spontaneous protest by some people that blocked the Prime Minister’s route,

the government was trying to defend the indefensible and run away from responsibility.

“If the Prime Minister of the country has to cancel all his programmes owing to a grave security breach, what should be the plight of the ordinary person living in Punjab?”

the former Chief Minister asked, while asserting that sooner this government was dismissed better it would be for the state and its people.

Capt Amarinder said, it was a deliberate mischief of the government to disrupt the Prime Minister’s programmes in Punjab,

as he was to start various development projects to the tune of more than Rs 50,000 crores, which would benefit the people of the state.

The former Chief Minister regretted that this government had stooped so low that it orchestrated disruption of the rally and did not provide proper security to the Prime Minister and he had to cancel his programmes.

Capt Amarinder said, what happened today was shameful and disgraceful and the Chief Minister cannot escape the responsibility for it”.

The Government of Haryana, with support from Deloitte, today launched “Sanjeevani Pariyojana” (or ‘the life project’), a supervised, virtual home care initiative to help people quickly access health care for mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19.

The approach taken by the Government of Haryana provides individuals with support and resources to manage their care at home including access to virtual triage,

as well as COVID-19 field hospitals and inpatient facilities when deemed appropriate by state-trained medical staff. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 24 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

The Haryana-Deloitte collaboration builds on the state’s existing telemedicine and other virtual medical care services for home treatment.

The program, designed and supported by Deloitte, the Public Health Foundation of India (Dr. K. Srinath Reddy) and the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Haryana (Dr. Dhruva Chaudhry),

is a critically important step in bringing much needed medical care to the people who need it most, when and where they need it most.

The pilot project will begin in the district of Karnal and may include a roll out to other affected areas shortly thereafter.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered an FIR against a Gujarat-based firm for defrauding Bank of India to the tune of Rs 631 crore, officials said.

The federal probe agency has named Electrotherm (India) Ltd, an Ahmedabad-based firm, its Director Mukesh Bhanwarlal Bhandari, Managing Directors Shailesh Bhanwarlal Bhandari, Avinash Prakashchandra Bhandari and Whole Time Director Narendra Babubhai Dalal as accused in the case along with unknown public servants.

Preparations are in full swing for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s January 5 rally in Ferozepur, his first of the poll season in Punjab.

With nine farmers’ unions vowing to protest against PM Modi’s visit, the police have increased vigilance in the area.

PM Modi is expected to address a crowd of one lakh soon after he lays the foundation stone of a 400-bed PGI satellite center in Ferozepur.

This is PM Modi’s first visit to Punjab since the repeal of the three farm laws. Security in Ferozepur has been heightened ahead of PM Modi’s visit.

The International Border (IB) is less than 15 kilometers away from the district, and with drone sightings being a commonality, no stone is being left unturned to ensure security for the PM’s event. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 24 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Lucknow, Jan 6 (PTI) Amid various political parties seeking to woo voters with promises of free power and other freebies ahead of the assembly polls, the Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday announced a 50 per cent cut on farmers’ electricity bills for running their tubewells.

The Chief Minister’s office made the announcement on its official Twitter handle that said the decision to slash the power bills has been taken in the interest of farmers.

While the CM’s office tweet tagged a picture of a newspaper advertisement announcing the relief for farmers, it also mentioned a cut in power bills for urban areas by half.

It was not immediately clear if the relief in urban areas was meant only for farmers in urban villages or all urban residents.

Ans: – Ceylon Graphite Corp. announced on Tuesday the receipt of renewal of its environmental protection licence from the Central Environmental Authority of Sri Lanka for its ongoing operations at the K1 mine.

The licence is valid for three years after having past an inspection that the operation conforms to stipulated standards, the company said in a press release.

Ceylon currently holds a land package constituting 121 km² grids containing historic vein graphite deposits in Sri Lanka. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 24 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

These exploration grids (each 1 km² in area) cover areas of historic graphite production from the early 20th century and represent a majority of the known graphite occurrences in Sri Lanka.

According to Ceylon, the “vein” graphite found in Sri Lanka has the highest in situ purity in the world, but make up just less than 1% of the world’s graphite production.

K1 is Ceylon’s first mining project in the country.

The mine site has been granted the highest category license in Sri Lanka, giving the company exclusive rights to mine, process and trade in graphite mined within the area specified in the licence.

“We are very pleased with our technical staff on site, having maintained compliance with the applicable environmental standards, and we look forward to applying these standards to our production growth vein graphite prospects in Sri Lanka,” Ceylon’s CEO Don Baxter said in the release.

He added that Ceylon is looking to “tick all the ESG boxes” for OEMs and investors alike as it continues to evolve into a stand-alone battery technology company.

‘Coral IVF’ aids Australia’s Great Barrier Reef

The world’s largest living structure is under threat from rising ocean temperatures linked to climate change, which have caused coral bleaching.

This year, however, has seen some recovery on the Great Barrier Reef.

Scientists have been using man-made pools in a process comparable to in vitro fertilisation (IVF), moving eggs from areas of the reef where coral has been growing.

These are then transferred in an effort to regenerate areas hit by bleaching or destruction from storms. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 24 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

The process of assisted spawning, dubbed “coral IVF”, aided the birth of billions of new coral babies this year, in an explosion of colour.

The reef is still facing substantial dangers, but scientists and conservationists hope these types of technologies can spur broader recovery in the world’s reefs, home to roughly a quarter of marine life

**The ozone layer is healing**

It was one of the key environmental causes of the 1980s: trying to prevent the hole in the ozone layer, which protects the planet from harmful UV rays, from getting any larger.

Activists mobilised street protests and politicians held summits.

And change is happening, according to a recent study by the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR): Because of the 1987 Montreal Protocol,

a global deal to regulate nearly 100 man-made chemicals that deplete the ozone layer, 443 million Americans will likely be spared from skin cancer through the end of this century.

The hole in the ozone layer remains enormous – about the size of North America – but it is recovering at a rate of one to three percent every 10 years, according to the UN.

The hole over parts of the northern hemisphere is expected to heal completely by the 2030s, with full repair over the southern hemisphere and polar  
regions expected by the 2060s, according to UN data.

Global action on the problem via the Montreal Protocol has prevented more than 99 percent of potential health effects that would have otherwise occurred from ozone destruction, NCAR reported. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 24 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

China’s giant pandas no longer ‘endangered’

Home to more than 1,800 giant pandas living in the wilderness, China reported in July that the iconic bears are no longer officially “endangered”.

Thanks to conservation efforts, they are now classified as just “vulnerable”.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature, an independent tracking group, made a similar assessment several years earlier.

Partial credit for the improvement in the giant panda population can be traced to an expanded network of protected areas in the world’s most populous country, covering about 18 percent of China’s landmass, according to Chinese authorities.

Renewable energy generation hits all-time high

Despite supply chain problems stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, 2021 was expected to set an all-time high for new renewable energy production capacity.

With new solar installations, wind farms and other technologies, the world added 290 gigawatts of renewable power production capacity this year,

according to a report published this month by the Paris-based International Energy Agency.

By comparison, that is twice as much as Canada’s total electricity generating capacity of about 145 gigawatts. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 24 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Based on these trends, renewable energy capacity could exceed the current global capacity of fossil fuels and nuclear energy combined by 2026.

Globally, more than 90 percent of new electricity generating capacity in the next five years is projected to come from renewables.

The pace of growth, however, is still not fast enough to reach the goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Give your observations.<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

Ans :- The media plays a key role in shaping public attitudes, including perceptions about women and men.

Gender-sensitive reporting shuns stereotypes that limit and trivialize women and men to present an accurate portrait of the world and its possibilities.

The news coverage of armed conflicts is profoundly gendered and largely male-dominated. Men are asked to explain and interpret the conflict in many different roles: as combatants, warlords, experts, and politicians.

Women’s opinions, on the other hand, are rarely asked and if they are, it is usually from the perspective of victims.

Integrating a gender lens into conflict reporting involves respecting the key standards of journalistic professionalism which impartially presents verified information in a fair and balanced context, gives voice to marginalised actors, and shuns gender stereotypes.

Prevention focuses on preventing all forms of violence against women and girls in peacetime, conflict and post-conflict situations.

It involves various measures including creasing prosecutions for perpetrators of conflict-related sexual violence, addressing impunity, increasing surveillance for women’s security and safety and challenging discriminatory gender norms, attitudes and behaviour. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 24 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

**Ans: – There are two kinds of fake news:**

• Stories that aren’t true. These are entirely invented stories designed to make people believe something false, to buy a certain product, or to visit a certain website.

<div class="code-block code-block-14" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both;"><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>

• Stories that have some truth, but aren’t 100 percent accurate. For example, a journalist quotes only part of what a politician says, giving a false impression of their meaning.

Again, this can be deliberate, to convince readers of a certain viewpoint, or it can be the result of an innocent mistake.

Either way, it quickly attracts an audience and can become entrenched as an “urban myth.”

Fake news is nothing new. But, what is new is how easy it’s become to share information – both true and false – on a massive scale.

Social media platforms allow almost anyone to publish their thoughts or share stories to the world. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 25 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

The trouble is, most people don’t check the source of the material that they view online before they share it, which can lead to fake news spreading quickly or even “going viral.”

At the same time, it’s become harder to identify the original source of news stories, which can make it difficult to assess their accuracy.

This has led to a flood of fake news. In fact, one study found that more than 25 percent of Americans visited a fake news website in a six-week period during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

But, not all fake news stories are found online.

Co-workers who gossip by the water cooler or while browsing print publications that fail to check their facts, for example, are also guilty of spreading misinformation, even if inadvertently.

Research shows that 59 percent of people are concerned about the effect that fake news has in the workplace, and with good reason!

For example, some people might start to believe that they no longer need evidence to back up their arguments. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 25 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Others start to mistrust information all together. They stop listening to industry reports, and disengage from official workplace communication, slowing their professional growth and development.

Ultimately, this can damage an organization’s learning culture.

Fake news can affect behavior, too. It encourages people to invent excuses, to dismiss others’ ideas, to exaggerate the truth, and to spread rumors.

This can create divided, anxious workplaces where people are cynical and unsure of who to trust.

They might even begin to mistrust you if they believe that authority figures have lied to them, or that the information that they are working with is suspect.

This can sap people of the curiosity, enthusiasm and ambition that they need to collaborate and to be successful.

Misinformation and fake news can also harm your business. Invented reviews of your products or inaccurate financial updates, for example, can do serious reputational damage

Ways to Spot Fake News

(1\. Develop a Critical Mindset

One of the main reasons fake news is such a big issue is that it is often believable, so it’s easy to get caught out. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 25 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Much fake news is also written to create “shock value,” that is, a strong instinctive reaction such as fear or anger.

This means it’s essential that you keep your emotional response to such stories in check. Instead, approach what you see and hear rationally and critically .

Ask yourself, “Why has this story been written? Is it to persuade me of a certain viewpoint? Is it selling me a particular product? Or is it trying to get me to click through to another website? Am I being triggered?”

(2\. Check the Source

If you come across a story from a source that you’ve never heard of before, do some digging!

Check the web address for the page you’re reading. Spelling errors in company names, or strangesounding extensions like “.infonet” and “.offer,” rather than “.com” or “.co.uk,” may mean that the source is suspect.

Whether or not the author or publisher is familiar, stop to consider their reputation and professional experience. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 25 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Are they known for their expertise on the matter? Or do they tend to exaggerate?

Be aware that people who spread fake news and “alternative facts” sometimes create web pages, newspaper mockups, or “doctored” images that look official, but aren’t.

So, if you see a suspicious post that looks like it’s from the World Health Organization (WHO), for example, check the WHO’s own site to verify that it’s really there.

(3\. See Who Else Is Reporting the Story

Has anyone else picked up on the story? What do other sources say about it?

Avoid leaping to the conclusion that all main stream media (MSM) output is fake. This can be as unwise as following every rumor or conspiracy theory.

Professional global news agencies such as Reuters, CNN and the BBC have rigorous editorial guidelines and extensive networks of highly trained reporters, so are a good place to start.

But no one is unbiased, and anyone can make a mistake, so keep looking.

(4\. Examine the Evidence <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 25 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

A credible news story will include plenty of facts – quotes from experts, survey data and official statistics, for example.

Or detailed, consistent and corroborated eye-witness accounts from people on the scene. If these are missing, question it!

Does the evidence prove that something definitely happened? Or, have the facts been selected or “twisted” to back up a particular viewpoint?

Ans: – Businessman Raj Kundra, who was arrested in a pornography case earlier this year and later granted bail, on Monday claimed he has never been involved in the production and distribution of pornographic content in his life.

In a statement issued on a social media platform, Raj, who is married to actor Shilpa Shetty, said the entire episode was nothing but a “witch hunt”.

The businessman also said he has already been pronounced “guilty” by the media and wished that his privacy is not intruded anymore with this continued “media trial”.

The Supreme Court last week granted protection from arrest to Raj in connection with an FIR registered against him for allegedly distributing pornographic videos.

In July this year, he was arrested by the Mumbai Police in another case where he was accused of distributing porn films through an app. He was granted bail in September.

The right to privacy is recognised as a fundamental right under the Constitution of India. It is guaranteed under the right to freedom (Article 19) and the right to life (Article 21) of the Constitution. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 25 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Article 19(1) (a) guarantees all citizens the right to freedom of speech and expression.

It is the right to freedom of speech and expression that gives the media the right to publish any information.

Reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right can be imposed by the State in the interests of sovereignty and integrity of the State,

the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence.

Article 21 of the Constitution provides, “No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.”

Internationally the right to privacy has been protected in a number of conventions. For instance, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 (UDHR) under Article 12 provides that:

“No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, or to attacks upon his honour and reputation.

Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.” <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 25 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

The UDHR protects any arbitrary interference from the State to a person’s right to privacy.

Similarly, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1976 (ICCPR) under Article 17 imposes the State to ensure that individuals are protected by law against “arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.

Thus, ensuring that States enact laws to protect individual’s right to privacy. India has ratified the above conventions.

The ratification of the Conventions mandates the State to take steps to enact laws to protect its citizens.

Although, human right activists have periodically demanded that the State take adequate measures to protect human rights of the vulnerable in society, the right to privacy has received little attention.

Similarly, Article 16 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) provides protection to a minor from any unlawful interference to his/her right to privacy and imposes a positive obligation on States who have ratified the convention to enact a law protecting the same. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 25 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

India does have safeguards in place to protect identity of minors, especially, juveniles and victims of abuse. However, there are exceptions when the law on privacy does not apply even in case of a minor.

Ans: – “Facts only account for 10% of the reactions on the stock market; everything else is psychology.”

André Kostolany, a stock market investor who made most of his fortune during the reconstruction of Europe after World War II, made this observation.

Renowned for his shrewd and astute mixture of psychology and his sensible knowledge of stocks and markets, Kostolany became one of the most successful investors of the 20th century.

The Internet was just emerging from its infancy when Kostolany died in 1999.

The evolution of data intelligence technologies have given us the capability to process and analyze vast amounts of online data, which means we can now test Kostolany’s intuition that markets are highly impacted by emotional reactions.

By monitoring and analyzing data from social media sources—especially with

regard to communication about stocks—it’s now possible to connect the dots between sentiment and market movements. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 25 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Like most other industries, the financial industry communicates by sharing information and data via the Internet and, eventually, through social media.

People interacting on social media generate emotional data by expressing their emotions and opinions via tweets, forum posts, and blogs.

They also consume it, and in the process are influenced by the sentiments, feelings, and opinions expressed by others.

Scientific studies show that people are often influenced by the data they consume, and that their decisions or actions are partly aligned with it.

Stock prices tick up and down constantly due to fluctuations in supply and demand. If more people want to buy a stock, its market price will increase.

If more people are trying to sell a stock, its price will fall. The relationship between supply and demand is highly sensitive to the news of the moment.

Nonetheless, chasing the news is not a good stock-picking strategy for the individual investor. In most cases, professional traders react in anticipation of an event, not when the event is reported. <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-base-3-color">MJM 25 Free Solved Assignment</mark>

Negative news will normally cause people to sell stocks.

A bad earnings report, a lapse in corporate governance, big-picture economic and political uncertainty, and unfortunate occurrences all translate to selling pressure and a decrease in the prices of many if not most stocks.

Zomato shares made a strong stock market debut on Friday, closing the initial day of trade at Rs 126 per share on the NSE.

Zomato’s stock price was up 66 per cent or Rs 50 from IPO price of Rs 76\. On opening, Zomato shares hit 20 per cent upper circuit at Rs 138, nearly doubling IPO investors money.

The total market capitalisation of the online food ordering platform stood at Rs 98,211 crore on the closing bell, down from Rs 1 lakh crore earlier in the day.

While on BSE, Zomato shares closed 65 per cent or Rs 49.86 higher at Rs 125.85 apiece. In traded volume terms, 451 lakh shares have exchanged hands on BSE, while 69.48 crore units traded on NSE.

The Rs 9,375-crore IPO was sold in a price band of Rs 74-76 a share during 14-16 July.

The mega public issue of the food-tech unicorn saw a subscription of over 38 times, receiving a robust response from all pockets of investors.

Zomato’s IPO is the first Indian internet unicorn to make its stock market debut. This much-awaited public issue is the largest to hit Dalal Street since SBI Cards and Payment Services’ Rs 10,341-crore IPO in March 2020.

1.  Dabur’s Fem Creme Gold Bleach Karwachauth ad
2.  Ceat’s Road Crackers ad featuring Aamir Khan  
    3.‘Jashn-e- Riwaaz’ campaign by FabIndia (400 words)

**Ans: –** Recently, consumer goods company Dabur and clothing brand FabIndia have been faced backlash and criticism for their advertisements.

Dabur on Monday withdrew an advertisement showing a same-sex couple celebrating the Hindu festival Karwa Chauth, hours after Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra warned of legal action against the firm.

Meanwhile, FabIndia has been at the receiving end of a lot of backlash ever since it brought out a Diwali-themed advertisement for a range of clothing collection and named it ‘Jashn-e-Riwaaz’.

The brand was accused of “defacing” the Hindu festival of Diwali and terming it Jashn-e-Riwaaz.

Many slammed the brand for unnecessarily uplifting secularism and Muslim ideologies in a Hindu festival.

The tweet was described by several sections of social media as “culturally inappropriate”.

After BJP leader Tejaswi Surya slammed the brand for ‘deliberate attempt of Abrahamisation of Hindu festivals, the advertisement also received a lot of flak for not portraying the models in ‘Hindu traditional clothes’.

**Tanishq ad :**

Last year, a Tanishq ad on interfaith marriage triggered a furious backlash on social media with some accusing the jewellery brand of promoting ‘love jihad’, prompting the company to withdraw the film citing hurt sentiments and the well-being of its staff.

The 43-second commercial, which led to the hashtag #BoycottTanishq trending on Twitter, shows a pregnant woman being led to her bridal shower, a Hindu custom called ‘godh bharai’, by a woman who viewers later realise is her mother-in-law.

The description of the video on YouTube read: She is married into a family that loves her like their own child.

Only for her, they go out of their way to celebrate an occasion that they usually don’t.

A beautiful confluence of two different religions, traditions, cultures.”

The commercial opened the floodgates of debate and trolling with a flurry of tweets, some angry and threatening, demanding a ban on the advertisement and a boycott of the brand, a Tata product.

**Surf Excel ad :**

Another advertisement went viral for the wrong reasons last year. Surf Excel was severely criticised for an ad showing Hindu-Muslim unity.

The HUL-owned brand, which is known for its “daag achhe hai” (stains are good) ads, tried to do something similar recently with its latest Holi special “Rang Laaye Sang” (colours bring us together) campaign.

Under this campaign, the brand released an advertisement in a bid to promote HinduMuslim unity. The advertisement ends with Surf Excel’s classic tagline “daag acche hain”.

**Amul ad :**

Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) — which makes Amul brand of food products — found its Twitter account blocked on the evening of 4 June, 2020 evening. The account was restored on 5 June.

Twitter was abuzz with several users expressing shock, while many questioned its move to restrict the account.

Twitterati linked the restriction of Amul’s account with the brand’s campaign supporting a boycott of Chinese products.

The brand figured among trending topics in India even on Saturday with over 11,500 tweets.
